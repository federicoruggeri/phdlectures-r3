# ****Robust and Reproducible Experimental Deep Learning Setting (RREDLS)****

This is the official repository of the PhD course "Robust and Reproducible Experimental Deep Learning Setting‚Äù.

## Abstract

With the advent of deep learning techniques and hardware breakthroughs, a lot of scientific
papers focus on contributing novel methods, strategies, tasks, and approaches in a wide
variety of domains.
One major bottleneck when developing novel research ideas is to define adequate experiments. Researchers aim to define experiments that corroborate their initial hypotheses.
Nonetheless, depending on the setup, defining such experiments may be non-trivial or, more
in general, prone to common errors.
In this course, we‚Äôll introduce different evaluation procedures for assessing a model‚Äôs performance (evaluation routines, controlled multi-seeding, evaluation criteria) and overview
different experimental research scenarios. Additionally, we‚Äôll also provide advanced coding
recommendations for defining a correct experimental setup. We‚Äôll use popular deep-learning
libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch.
This course is recommended for researchers who are experienced with Python programming
and any deep learning framework (Keras, Tensorflow, Torch). See Section Prerequisites for
more details.

## Exam

If you need to certify your participation in the course via an exam, you can choose one option
from the ones reported below. All submissions are made by contacting me via email.

- [Review] You can report a review you have made concerning the experimental setup
of a paper of your choice. Please submit your review in .pdf format (1-2
pages at most). I kindly ask you to analyze the pros and cons of the
considered experimental setup.
- [Code] You can submit a code snippet (either a GitHub repo or a notebook) describing how you used certain advanced deep learning APIs/functionalities
(e.g., efficient data loading, parallel training, custom architectures, etc..). I
kindly ask you to report a .pdf report (1-2 pages at most) that summarizes
and motivates your implementation. You can submit code snippets used
in your research activity.
- [deasy-learning] As a variant of the Code option, you can submit a code snippet written
using my deep-learning library. As in Code, I kindly ask you to report a
.pdf report. Feedbacks are welcome!
